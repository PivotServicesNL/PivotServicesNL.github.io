#### A Well-Considered Balance
There is no 'perfect' model for listing products, as there are typically multiple trade-offs in complexity, CR, traffic, and discoverability. In general, there are three main elements to develop for select products families (parent/child SKU) following a local competition audit.
            
| Impressions        | Search           | Ambition |
| ------------- |:-------------:| -----:|
| Category Rank     | By Department | Tag |
| Keyword Result     | Search Engine      | Traffic |
| Reviews | Comparative      |   Conversion |
